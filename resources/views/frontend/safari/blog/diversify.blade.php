                        Diversification of Tropical fruit product

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Goshen has successfully integrated farmers from Lower Eastern Kenya and the Coast into its sourcing
                        portfolio, promoting sustainability and economic resilience. Initially focused on the value addition
                        of mangoes, Goshen has expanded its product range to include other tropical fruits such as coconut,
                        papaya, and pineapple. This diversification not only enhances factory efficiency but also caters to
                        a broader clientele seeking their favorite fruit snacks.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        By integrating a wide variety of crops, Goshen contributes to sustainable agricultural practices,
                        reducing environmental impacts while improving soil health. Moreover, by offering training and
                        support to local farmers, Goshen is actively reducing poverty in these communities, providing them
                        with opportunities to generate stable incomes and improve their livelihoods.

                        Goshenâ€™s commitment to minimizing post-harvest losses is a critical aspect of its operations. By
                        implementing efficient processing techniques and ensuring timely distribution, the organization
                        maximizes the value of the harvested fruits, ensuring that less goes to waste.
