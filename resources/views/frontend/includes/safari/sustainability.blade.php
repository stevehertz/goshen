                    <h4>Sustainable Waste Management</h4>
                    <p class="mb-4">
                        Goshen has found innovative ways of utilizing its waste. First the Organic waste from our
                        processing plants is recycled to produce biogas, minimizing environmental impact. The biogas is
                        used to displace non-renewable energy during factory operation. Second the waste is also
                        processed on site into bio fertilizer frass through being fed to Black Soldier Flies creating a
                        highly valuable soil input. This is good for soil, affordable to the farmers and great for the
                        planet.

                    <p class="mb-4">
                        We train and help farmers embrace climate sustainable practices that contribute to soil health
                        and reduce emissions. Through this farmers have embraced resilience in production while also
                        strategically growing fruit trees and vines for fruits while at the same time enhancing
                        vegetation cover especially in Semi-arid areas.

                        Goshen’s activities have harnessed social economic impacts including creation of direct and
                        indirect jobs including factory staff who are mainly women. The company also creates indirect
                        jobs including service providers, aggregators and even the thousands of farmers contracted to
                        contractually grow fruits for Goshen.
